## Subscription Example README

The Subis subscription example repository demonstrates how to use the Subis API to verify user subscriptions in a Next.js application. It showcases an API endpoint that:

- Receives a signed transaction from the connected wallet
- Verifies the signature to ensure the user is subscribed
- Grants access to the service based on the subscription status

This example serves as a reference for integrating Subis into applications where the actual service is provided to subscribed users.

The example interacts with the deployed Subscription Manager contract to verify subscriptions and ensure only eligible users can access the service.
